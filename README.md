## Featured Projects üíª


### [Research Crew](https://github.com/factoredai/research-crew/tree/langraph-implementation)

Research Crew is an agentic workflow that takes a research topic and general research plan to execute research and produce different types of content. This project uses the LangGraph framework to create a modular and extensible workflow for generating structured reports from web-based and user-provided content.

The project follows SOLID principles and has a clear modular structure, making it easy to extend and maintain. It's designed to be run in a development container for a consistent environment across contributors.


### [LSSVM](https://github.com/RomuloDrumond/LSSVM)

Python implementation of Least Squares Support Vector Machine for classification on CPU (NumPy) and GPU (PyTorch).

### [SOM](https://github.com/RomuloDrumond/SOM)

Python implementation of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) on CPU (NumPy) and GPU (PyTorch).
